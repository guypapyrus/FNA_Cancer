# FNA_Cancer
This was the final project for a pilot data science class at Moorpark College in California offered Spring 2023 with Dr. Brendan Purdy (M37DS: Probability & Statistics for Data Science).

Using R, we explored various machine learning algorithms' abilities to predict malignancy/benignness of breast cancer tumors from a set of physical measurements. Available files include:
* R Notebook with code and documentation
* HTML output of .rmd file
* Source data
* Slide presentation of findings
